# R-D_Claim_PNF_Tool

Hi all enjoyed playing around with the site and making this (appologies for delays)

The main site can be opened by going to the `Structure/index.html` file and opened from there.

Simply pull the code locally open the file in your browser.

I was unsure if the component library from hubspot would be perminant or would need to be substituted so I made the code largely compatable with both.

If you wanted to switch over you will only need to observe the differences in the `style/qm.css` file which has some minor differences.

p.s. the background is only beige to make the prenotification section pop more. Feel free to remove

Full details can be found in the documentation section (goes over the process of investigation and how the output was reached (I write the documentation at the same time as completing tasks as part of my work method))

# Possible Improvements
- remove dependancy on form-group and form-row classes from hubspot.
- create json object to save state of answers for future tracking
- Google analyitics intergraion with GTM instance
